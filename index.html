                    <p>Located on a 1000 acre farm in <strong>Avalon</strong> where the King Arthur & Holy Grail legends originated, Glastonbury boasts 175,000 spectators and over 100 stages with the biggest artists, bands & DJ's in the world. It is truly mind blowing!</p>

                    <p>My festival closing sets at <strong>Tribunion</strong> & <strong>Khumeia</strong> and my performances after U.K. headliners like <strong>Krafty Kuts</strong> and <strong>Mista Trick</strong> have given me a reputation as a highly entertaining closer.

                    <p>In 2005, I remixed one of their songs for a film and hired <strong>Moment Factory</strong> to make the music video. The success of the remix led to me joining the band. So far I collaborated on five albums and one DVD. I was the Guitarist and Tour Manager for our live performances at the <strong>Glastonbury Festival</strong> (U.K.), <strong>Telerama Dub Festival</strong> (Paris) and Musique Multi Montreal.</p>

I was working on projects with the perfect partner for them so I facilitated a relationship with <strong>Awesome Global Events</strong>. Soon after <strong>Pacha</strong> (Ibiza) and <strong>Ministry of Sound</strong> (London) joined the team.</p>
                    <p>The result was a 4 day festival featuring Grammy Award winning artists like <strong>Skrillex</strong> and <strong>Avicii</strong>. The location was at the pool of the glamorous Raleigh Hotel. Sponsors joined such as Belvédère and Moët and celebrities such as Paris Hilton and Paula Abdul attended.</p>

The audience are surrounded by the video projections, fully immersed in a cutting edge sensory experience. With a state of the art sound system that features 157 speakers.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>Arcadia Festival</strong> is for video game designers. For the GAMMA event, we explored the relationship between audio and the artificial intelligence of games. Eight companies created games where the action was dictated by the dynamic changes in the music. The output of each musical performance was plugged into the gaming consoles. The audience were in effect playing versus the DJ's.</p>

                    <p>In 2023 I co-founded the <strong>Flamingo Funk</strong> crew with DJ Melodrastik to create events for the latest underground sounds in Bass Music. Our first event was to bring UK Breakbeat pioneer <strong>Krafty Kuts</strong> to Montreal to perform. Renowned for his turntablism and original productions, he is a seminal force in the UK's Breakbeat and Bass scene.</p>
                    <p>We created flamingo avatars for all the performers, postered the city and decorated the venue with flamingos. The audience came dressed in flamingo apparel. I had the honor of doing the closing set right after Krafty Kuts and it was a massive success! Bass Face in full effect!</p>

                    <p>In 2024 <strong>Flamingo Funk</strong> teamed up with Tesla Nights and with bass music crews in multiple cities. We booked <strong>Mista Trick</strong> from Bristol (UK) for a mini tour of Quebec and Ontario. He is in a league of his own as a DJ & Producer, mixing vintage, vaudeville vibes with down and dirty drum n bass.</p>
                    <p>He revolutionized the sound of electro swing music and founded the <strong>Swing & Bass</strong> label that has taken the world by storm. A prolific producer & remixer he also performs live with a full band the Mista Trick Collective.</p>
                    <p>Once again I had the honor of performing the closing set and it was pandemonium!</p>

                    <p>On Halloween 2023, I joined experimental post rock band <strong>Antennae</strong> to create immersive concerts for <strong>Nomad Slow TV</strong>, broadcast on ROKU. We created improvised soundscapes surrounded by video projections with mirrors reflecting it all back.</p>
                    <p><em>"Piki Chappell caressed the cello while Guapo's atmospheric guitar painted the night with shadow and light. Karina Marquez Caballero's vocals soared with spectral wings. Dan Handelman's guitar strummed beauty. Quentin Noël Bourbeau's fingers danced on the piano keys. John Juster's saxophone sang with the voice of an autumn wind. Together, they crafted an immersive sonic journey of rhythm and vibration."</em></p>
                    <p>The project and all the video projections were created by <strong>Jason Rodi</strong>, the co-founder of Moment Factory and the founder of Nomad.</p>

                    <p>Since 2022 I host shows for <strong>Radio La Face B</strong>. I began by creating a world music show called <em>Global Grooves</em>. Each episode I explored the musical traditions of a culture and combine it with electronic music. So far I explored the music of India, Brazil, Latin America, West Africa, North Africa, the Middle East and Asia Minor. I currently host the show <strong>Pépites</strong> the third Thursday of every month at 9 pm.</p>
                    <p>Since 2023 I have been a guest host on <strong>CKUT 90.3 FM</strong> for shows hosted by the highly respected DJ Andy Williams. I create a show the first Sunday of every month from 2pm-4pm for <em>The Magic Roundabout</em>. I create DJ mixes exploring underground bass music.</p>

                    <p>Discovered by <strong>Peter Gabriel</strong>, Alpha's music is a blend of the Malenke, Sousou and Foulani cultures. 20 years ago he moved to Canada and he has since won four <strong>Juno Awards</strong>. He sang on the score to the hit film "District 9".</p>

                    <p>We proposed 5 candidates including the winner, a Norwegian artist named <strong>Anja</strong>. She recorded several singles for the best selling <strong>Just Dance</strong> franchise.</p>
                    <p>All the candidates I proposed went on to have amazing careers. They included Sheenah Ko, Annie Sama, Belle Scar and <strong>Grimes</strong>, who six months later became a huge international star signed to the British label 4AD.</p>

                    <p>In 2001 I founded <strong>Finite Music</strong>, a studio and record label that specialized in music for films & TV. We were a team of composers, music supervisors and music editors. For my first feature film I received a nomination for the <strong>2002 Jutra Award for Best Original Score</strong>.</p>
                    <p>For "3 Saisons", I worked with popular Québécois actors like <strong>Caroline Néron</strong> and <strong>Romano Orzari</strong>. The film won a multitude of awards internationally.</p>
                    <p>For "The Eye in the Son" by <strong>Moment Factory</strong>, I used the sound of footsteps on snow, wind and heavy breathing to re-create the environment of Mont Everest. For the film Pure I had to re-create the environment of afterhours electronic music clubs, the trippy musical journey the DJ takes you on.</p>
